Hi! My name is Josh Burdick; I am a programmer, mostly in bioinformatics
(and a part-time musician). So I don't study complexity "by day".
However, I was in grad school at Maryland in the late 90's.  Among
the classes I took was Gasarch's lower bounds class, which piqued
my interest.

Sometime around 2016, I started thinking about Shannon's function-counting
argument, and whether it said anything about detecting cliques.
This led to the set of functions BUGGYCLIQUE: "functions which
detect some subset of cliques" [1] This showed that detecting, say,
half of the possible cliques, requires many gates, at least on
average.  However, it said frustratingly little about detecing _all_
the cliques...

I have been trying to extend this result to detecting all the
cliques, by trying to connect the number of cliques a BUGGYCLIQUE
function detects, with the number of gates it has.

I don't think that I've managed to do this, at least to a publishable
point. But I have written up my speculations about this [2]. I
have some questions about it, which I'm hoping seasoned circuit
complexity thinkers might be able to answer. The questions:

1. My main question: Is the random walk bound (in section 1.3.4)
correct? The walk is between sets of cliques: the bounds are on how
much each ``step'' of that walk changes the number of cliques, and
the number of gates.

Smaller questions:

2. If it _isn't_ correct, can it be tweaked to be something correct,
and useful? Or, does it have useful ideas?

3. If it is correct, what bound does the associated integer program
give, for larger input sizes? (The LP relaxation involves really
large numbers, which seem to require using exact rational arithmetic,
raising practical problems.)

Although the writeup includes a metaphor involving a martini glass,
it's not intended as an April Fool's joke (as the calendar attests).
Whether it should have been may be an open question...

Comments appreciated.

Thanks!  Josh Burdick
