This is an attempt at adapting Jeremy Kun's implementation (and explanation)
of the simplex algorithm, to use Python's `fraction` type.

The explanation is at
[Linear Programming and the Simplex Algorithm](http://jeremykun.com/2014/12/01/linear-programming-and-the-simplex-algorithm/)
[https://doi.org/10.59350/gmd5d-af439](https://doi.org/10.59350/gmd5d-af439)

I modified code from:
[https://github.com/j2kun/simplex-algorithm](https://github.com/j2kun/simplex-algorithm)

Note that this currently is *not* working. Some of the unit tests pass, but others don't.
