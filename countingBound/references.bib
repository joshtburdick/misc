	abstract = {We consider several well-studied problems in dynamic algorithms and prove that sufficient progress on any of them would imply a breakthrough on one of five major open problems in the theory of algorithms: 1. Is the 3SUM problem on \$n\$ numbers in \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{2-{\textbackslash}epsilon\})\$ time for some \${\textbackslash}epsilon{\textgreater}0\$? 2. Can one determine the satisfiability of a CNF formula on \$n\$ variables in \$O((2-{\textbackslash}epsilon){\textasciicircum}n poly n)\$ time for some \${\textbackslash}epsilon{\textgreater}0\$? 3. Is the All Pairs Shortest Paths problem for graphs on \$n\$ vertices in \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{3-{\textbackslash}epsilon\})\$ time for some \${\textbackslash}epsilon{\textgreater}0\$? 4. Is there a linear time algorithm that detects whether a given graph contains a triangle? 5. Is there an \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{3-{\textbackslash}epsilon\})\$ time combinatorial algorithm for \$n{\textbackslash}times n\$ Boolean matrix multiplication? The problems we consider include dynamic versions of bipartite perfect matching, bipartite maximum weight matching, single source reachability, single source shortest paths, strong connectivity, subgraph connectivity, diameter approximation and some nongraph problems such as Pagh's problem defined in a recent paper by Patrascu [STOC 2010].},

	abstract = {Finding minimum circuits in graphs and digraphs is discussed. An almost minimum circuit is a circuit which may have only one edge more than the minimum. An 0(n2) algorithm is presented to find an almost minimum circuit. The straightforward algorithm for finding a minimum circuit has an 0(ne) behavior. It is refined to yield an 0(n2) average time algorithm. An alternative method is to reduce the problem of finding a minimum circuit to that of finding a triangle in an auxiliary graph. Three methods for finding a triangle in a graph are presented. The first has an 0(e3/2) worst case bound ((n) for planar graphs); the second takes 0(n5/3) time on the average; the third has an 0(nlog7) worst case behavior. For digraphs, recent results of Bloniarz, Fisher and Meyer are used to obtain an algorithm with 0(n2logn) average behavior.},
