        "The previous code block failed with a `ValueError` in the `modulo` library, specifically \"congruence class has no inverse\". This happens when attempting to divide by a `modulo` object that is not relatively prime to the modulus. In the `compute_a_and_b` function, this occurs during the calculation `modulo(n, m) // y`. Since we are setting `y=1` in the `factor` function call, the division is by `modulo(1, m)`. This error indicates that the `modulo(1, m)` object is somehow not invertible, which is unexpected when the residue is 1. Looking at the traceback, the error seems to originate from `b = (y - x) // 2` and then diving into the `modulo` library. However, the division by 2 is outside of the `modulo` operation in that line. The division inside `compute_a_and_b` is `modulo(n, m) // y`. Since we are setting `y=1`, it should be `modulo(n, m) // modulo(1, m)`. The error message \"congruence class has no inverse\" strongly suggests an issue with the inverse calculation within the `modulo` library when the divisor is `modulo(1, m)`. Let's try to debug the `compute_a_and_b` function call within the `check_for_factors` function. The error occurs when calling `compute_a_and_b(n, 1, math.prod(primes))`. Let's print the arguments being passed to `compute_a_and_b` just before the call to see if anything looks unusual.\n",
