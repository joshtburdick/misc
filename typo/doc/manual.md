## Types?





## Base types

int is usually considered a "base type". But number theory can be difficult.
Compilers often have had things like "a+0 = a" hard-wired, but it seems hard
to draw a line of "what compilers should be able to prove".

Thus, in typo, integer arithmetic will hopefully be implemented in library functions.
